# dwmblocks
Modular status bar for dwm written in c.
# modifying blocks
The statusbar is made from text output from commandline programs.
Blocks are added and removed by editing the blocks.h header file.
# changes made
Removed all default blocks in blocks.h, added my own, which are provided in the "modules" folder.
